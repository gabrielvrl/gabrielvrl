### Hey! I'm Gabriel Varela. Nice to meet you 🤝


I'm a Brazilian SWE focused on develop high quality Front-end and Mobile applications using ReactJS, Next.js and React Native. A bit of back-end and devops enthusiastic.

What drives me is to develop and ship products and/or services that impacts the people and the world in a positive way. And, to be able to do that, coding is the way to go in my opinion.

My engineering background also consists, but it's not limited to, Node.js, MongoDB, SQLite, C++, Python, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Networks and Graphs.
